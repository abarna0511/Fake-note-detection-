System overview: Fake currency detection using MATLAB typically involves image processing and machine learning techniques. 

Implementation steps:

Step 1:Image Acquisition:
   The first step is to acquire images of both genuine and fake currency. The images should be in a consistent format for accurate analysis.

Step 2:Preprocessing:
   To ensure consistency, preprocessing is done to enhance the image quality. 

Grayscale Conversion: Converts the image to a grayscale format to reduce complexity.
 Edge Detection: Detects the edges of important features like watermarks, patterns, and text.
Noise Removal: Filters out any noise to improve the quality of the image.
 Step 3:Feature Extraction:
   In this step, key features of the currency are extracted.

Texture: Using techniques like Local Binary Patterns (LBP) or Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM).
Security Marks: Extracting watermarks, security threads, microtext, etc.
Holograms: These can be identified based on their reflectance patterns.

Step 4:Pattern Recognition (Machine Learning):
   After extracting features, machine learning classifiers are used to differentiate between fake and real currencies. 

Step 5:Evaluation:
   After training your model, you would need to evaluate it using a test dataset. You can use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to judge the model’s performance.

Step 6:  Final Decision:
   Based on the classifier's output, the system will label the currency as either real or fake.
 Workflow:
1. Acquire currency image.
2. Preprocess the image (grayscale, noise reduction, etc.).
3. Extract relevant features (texture, security marks).
4. Classify using a machine learning algorithm.
5. Evaluate the model’s accuracy on new images.
